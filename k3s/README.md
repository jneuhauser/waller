It is assumed that a single host should only run one single instance of `k3s`, either as `server` or as `agent`

| `data_dir`            | dir       | absolute path.  k3s will create it if not present yet.  Note that k3s has a default `/var/lib/rancher/k3s` and it's tmpfs on OpenWrt |
| `bind_address`        | ipaddr    | For `server`, The address api server binds to                                                                                        |
| `https_listen_port`   | port      | For `server`, The port api server binds to                                                                                           |
| `server`              | url       | For `agent`, the k3s server api url.  Usually it's something like `https://xxx:6443`                                                 |
| `token`               | string    | For `agent`, the auth token generated by k3s server.  Usually it's stored by server at `<data_dir>/server/node-token`                |
